# Customer Yearly Spending Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a **linear regression model** to predict the **total yearly amount spent** by customers based on various behavioral features. The dataset includes information such as:
- Time spent on the website
- Time spent on the mobile app
- Length of membership
- Frequency of sessions

By analyzing these features, the model helps businesses understand customer spending patterns and optimize marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information with the following columns:
- `Avg. Session Length` – Average time spent per session
- `Time on App` – Time spent on the mobile application
- `Time on Website` – Time spent on the website
- `Length of Membership` – Duration of customer membership
- `Yearly Amount Spent` – Target variable (amount spent by the customer in a year)
